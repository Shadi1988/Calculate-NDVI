# Using Remote Sensing data and NDVI to identify locations of air quality measurements in Potsdam Germany


* Spatio-temporal and analyzing the index of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index maps for several years for the purpose of installing air quality sensors in Potsdam area in Germany.
The data will be the atmospheric correction and high-resolution (10m) Sentinel-2 images then creating masks to identify higher NDVI values, and
then classify them by using image segmentation. We are finally going to download a higher resolution map around 20 cm into our regions of interest by using QGIS.
